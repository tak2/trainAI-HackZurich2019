# trainAI-HackZurich2019
trainAI- Siemens challenge  -HackZurich2019
## Inspiration
Use **AI** to identify the gps position of field devices and guide technicians to the exact position of faulty devices 
## What it does
Pinpointing faulty equipment on train tracks using AI to map the location of equipment from video taken from train cockpit to have accurate GPS location
## How we built it
Frontend: 
Android for the navigation to the faulty devices
Backend :
Keras and tensorflow to identify the devices from the images 
Python to match the output to the documentation data 
And extract a data base for the frontend

## Challenges we ran into
-Identifying the devices as they don't have a unique ID
-having split tracks with different devices without knowing the exact path of the train 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for trainAI
Identification of foreign objects and debris on the train  tracks and tagging its location
